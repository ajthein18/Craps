COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

Really nice job of implementing this, Andrew! I love how you broke out the
game into its own class, leaving the main() method to call that class--you
could have done the same thing with the instructions, of course, to clean
it up even further.

You didn't implement the default (Y/n) feature as indicated in the project
handout--that's something you should consider for next time. In the meantime,
this is good work! Keep it up!

SCORE: 15/15
